uxdstools 0.4
-------------
You can now add and delete memberUids from group accounts
with lgroupmod.

Created man pages for each executable.  They are not formatted
correctly, but they display OK.  TODO: fix this.

Password options (-p/-P) work now with -c when GSSAPI is enabled.
The cache will be placed where the -c arg input tells it to.
(basically using putenv() when needed with KRB5CCNAME)

Moved lacctparse.c in line with the rest of the code to use args.c.
This involved eliminating the parsedata struct and two char*'s that
didn't need to be in a struct anyway.


uxdstools 0.3
-------------
Initial release (what happened to 0.1 and 0.2????)
Really wan't completely finished I realized to my dismay.
But hey, this is alpha stuff.
