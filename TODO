* ldap.c - need to refactor the functions - especially uxds_ldap_add()
           probably split into a varadic function whose last arg is a callback
           or two

* better data structures, period.

* move stuff into src/* directories

* make a shared lib and ditch the crap I have - libuxds

GET OUT OF THE N00B STAGE OF MEMORY MANAGEMENT!!!!!
this is my ultimate goal for this project...

devel on alpha is pre-alpha, so YMMV.

much respect to no-exit
