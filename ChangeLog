---------------

2008-07-30	Michael Brown <mikal@mikro-net.com>

	* resolv.sh: added logic to detect machine type through `uname -m`

		to x86_64 arch


uxdstools 0.5.2
---------------

2008-07-24	Michael Brown <mikal@mikro-net.com>

2008-03-08	Michael Brown <mikal@mikro-net.com>

	* krb5.c, args.c, ldap.c, sudoldap.c: removed unused LDAPMod structs
	        and other variables to fix gcc warnings
			
	* ltools.h: added missing header includes ctype.h, err.h and
	            parse_time.h

	* Makefile.am:  added -Wall and -DLDAP_DEPRECATED=1 to gcc arguments
	

uxdstools 0.5
---------------

2008-02-20	Michael Brown <mikal@mikro-net.com>

	* krb5.c: added setpwd() for -y switch with gssapi - sets pass from 
	          argument to krb5Key attribute - used with randstr() for now
	          changed get_tkts() to use auth.password with
		  krb5_get_init_creds_opt_set_pa_password()
		  changed get_krbname() for parse arg to switch return char
		  with either principal short name or creds cache location for
		  putenv() calls

	* configure.in: added logic for sudoers enable (--enable-sudoers)
	   		added logic for logging enable (--enable-log)
			added logic for Qmail attrs enable (--enable-qmail)
			added logic for ssh-lpk attrs enable (--enable-sshlpk)

	* Makefile.am: added logic for sudoers enable

	* log.c: added logging function log_event() and curdate()

	* strings.c: fixed passget() to put everything on one line and handle
	             backspace character correctly, and strdup() on return
		     for better string handle
		     added randstr() for 8 character random password gen
		     added base64() for krb5Key attribute LDIF export

	* lsudomod.c: created - calls uxds_sudo_mod()

	* lsudodel.c: created - calls uxds_sudo_del()

	* lsudoadd.c: created - calls uxds_sudo_add()

	* sudoldap.c: created - functions for lsudoadd, lsudodel, lsudomod -
	              uxds_sudo_add(), uxds_sudo_del(), uxds_sudo_mod()
		      added ifdefs for logging enable

	* args.c: removed huge bug in parse_argvs() - arg binary[] wtf??
	          added -y for password set with gssapi
	          changed _optmask() from ugly if statements to switch for 
	          flag determination
		  added sudoers arguments
		  added baseDN argument for base DN choice
		  added -V or SASL output INTERACTIVE may move to debug
		  added get_tkts() call for -y switch to grab kadmin/changepw
		  added -e for account expiry
		  principal: sets mdata.cpw to 1
		  added -L for LDIF export in lacctparse


	* ltools.h: changed prototype for parse_argvs()
	            added #include sys/errno.h for codes for logging
		    and ENOMEM
	            added basedn to authzdata for choice [-b] switch
		    added cpw to mod_data structure for change pw flag
		    added ldif to authzdata structure for LDIF path

	* ldap.c: removed some for loops that used ldap_get_attributes(),
	          went straight to ldap_get_values() for what was needed
		  instead in uxds_acct_add() and uxds_acct_mod()
	          - much needed cleanup of the LDAPMod structure
	          handling, doing this eliminated ~50 lines of code -
		  - this affected uxds_acct_add(), uxds_acct_mod(), and
		  uxds_grp_mem()
		  added ifdefs for logging enable, qmail & sshlpk attrs
		  added logic for multiple members add with lgroupadd and
		  add/delete with lgroupmod
		  added setpwd() calls in uxds_acct_add() & uxds_acct_mod() for
		  the user add/mod operations
		  added listing all selected accounts in directory in
		  uxds_acct_parse() if no account argument was input
		  added uxds_user_expire() for account expiry using either
		  krb5PasswordEnd or pwdReset - with logic for Samba & AD
		  for future use
		  added base64() call for uxds_acct_parse() when GSSAPI
		  enabled - base64's the krb5Key attribute when LDIF export is
		  chosen

uxdstools 0.4
-------------

	* lacctparse.c: eliminated the argument parsing out of main() and
	                moved into the fold using args.c

	* args.c: cleaned up parse_argvs() and _optmask() for lacctparse.c
		  acceptance, added putenv() call for kerb ccache location
		  choice

	* ldap.c: calculate new gidNumber from chosen group and modify
	          gidNumber attr to reflect change in user modrdn portion of
		  uxds_acct_mod(),
	          - fixed uxds_acct_parse() for lacctparse to use args.c
	          functions and the new vars in authzdata
		  - added uxds_grp_mem() to handle memberUid adds/deletes
		  from group accounts

	* ltools.h: eliminated parsedata, cleaned up prototypes

	* strings.c: added realmtodn() for future use

	* lacctparse.1, luseradd.1, lusermod.1, luserdel.1,
	  lgroupadd.1, lgroupmod.1, lgroupdel.1: all created manpages

Initial release (what happened to 0.1 and 0.2????)
Really wan't completely finished I realized to my dismay.
But hey, this is alpha stuff.
